						I have a BSc in Geography with a minor in GIS and Environmental Analysis from the São Paulo State University, a MSc degree in Remote Sensing from the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research, and a PhD in Geography (Geoinformatics) from the University of St Andrews. During 2019, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning at the Arizona State University - US. Between 2020 and 2021, I was a Research and Teaching Fellow in the School of Geography and Sustainable Development at the University of St Andrews - UK. During the first semester of 2022, I will work as an ULAM Fellow at the institute of Geodesy and Geoinformatics at Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences - PL. Starting June 2022, I will become a Lecturer in the School of Earth and Environment at the University of Canterbury - NZ. I am interested broadly in GIScience, remote sensing, human mobility, and movement analytics.
